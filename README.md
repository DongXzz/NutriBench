# NutriBench

Welcome to the official repository for NutriBench.

NutriBench consists of 5000 queries, varying in complexity based on the number, servings, and popularity of food items in each meal. All data can be accessed in the [`data`](data) directory. The subsets are named according to the following format: `{serving unit}_{retrieval_type}_{number_of_food}_{number_of_serving}.json`. For example, `natural_direct_single_multiple.json` indicates queries with natural serving, direct retrieval, single food, and multiple servings.
